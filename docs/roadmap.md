# Feature roadmap

Where gocrawl is today and where it's headed. This is a direction document, not a dated
release plan — the project is an early, working vertical slice, so items are grouped by status
and theme rather than committed to timelines.

## ✅ Shipped (v1)

The current baseline. Everything here works today.

- **Concurrent crawl engine** — raw-HTML fetching with configurable depth, page cap,
  worker concurrency, and per-request timeout. ([`internal/crawler`](../internal/crawler))
- **Scope & politeness controls** — `robots.txt` compliance, rate limiting,
  include/exclude URL regexes, subdomain and external-link toggles, custom User-Agent.
- **Redirect capture** — full redirect chains recorded per page, with loop detection.
- **Ten analyzers** — the SEO/technical set `seo`, `redirects`, `links`, `robots`,
  `sitemap`, `structured`, `perf`, plus the SEA set `utm`, `tracking`, `landing`. See the
  [Analyzer reference](analyzers.md).
- **Headless rendering (chromedp)** — `--render headless` (or `render: headless` in YAML)
  renders pages in a real Chromium tab via [chromedp][chromedp], capturing the post-JS DOM
  for downstream analyzers. Requires a Chromium-class browser on PATH; falls back to a raw
  HTTP fetch per page on rendering error so a single broken page doesn't stall the crawl.
- **Lab-mode Core Web Vitals** — the [`perf`](analyzers.md#perf--core-web-vitals) analyzer
  reports real LCP, FCP, CLS, TBT, and TTFB from the headless renderer against Google's
  thresholds. INP is field-only and not directly measurable in synthetic crawls; gocrawl
  follows the Lighthouse convention and reports TBT as a lab-mode responsiveness proxy.

- **SEA analyzers** — UTM-parameter auditing (`utm`), tracking-pixel / GTM / GA4 / Meta-Pixel
  detection (`tracking`), and landing-page relevance (`landing`). Each was added as a new
  `analyze.Analyzer` with **no changes to the crawl engine** — the worked example for the
  analyzer architecture (see [Architecture](architecture.md#adding-an-analyzer)).
- **JSON, CSV & HTML reports** — JSON (default) and CSV for tooling, plus a self-contained
  HTML page (inline CSS, no JS, no external assets) for sharing as an artifact. See the
  [Output reference](output.md).
- **MCP server** — drive crawls from agentic tools via the `crawl` and `list_analyzers`
  tools. See the [MCP guide](mcp.md).
- **Layered configuration** — defaults → YAML → env → flags, with `gocrawl init` to
  scaffold a config. See the [Configuration reference](configuration.md).

## 🚧 In progress / stubbed

No tracked items at the moment.

## 📋 Planned — platform

Broader capabilities beyond individual checks.

- **Resumable crawls** — checkpoint and continue large crawls.
- **Export integrations** — push results to external sinks/tools.
